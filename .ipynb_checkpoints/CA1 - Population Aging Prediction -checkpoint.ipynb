    "A large amount of data has been collected by The Central Statistics Office in Ireland in relation to the population of Ireland, This data is available at:  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://data.cso.ie/product/pme\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to choose a particular area of interest and formulate the appropriate questions for modelling and analysis. For Example (but not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "Annual Population Change\n",
    "Immigration and Migration\n",
    "Population Forecasting\n",
    " etcâ€¦\n",
    "You are required to collect, process, analyse and interpret the data in order to identify possible issues/problems at present and make predictions/classifications in regard to the future. This analysis will rely on the available data from CSO and any additional data you deem necessary (with supporting evidence) to support your hypothesis for this scenario.\n",
